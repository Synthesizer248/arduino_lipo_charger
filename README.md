## Features
- **Automatic Calibration**: Using internal AREF (1.1V) for precise ADC readings.
- **Menu System**: Scrollable menu for presets, calibration, and settings.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Displays charging voltage, current, and time on a 16x2 LCD.
- **Internal Resistance Measurement**: Assess battery health by measuring internal resistance.
- **Save/Reset Settings**: Save and reset configurations via the menu system.
- **Safety Features**: Over-voltage and over-current protection.
